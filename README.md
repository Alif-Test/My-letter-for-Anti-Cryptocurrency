Dear Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Jerome Powell, Janet Yellen, Gary Gensler, Charles Rettig, and Lina Khan

I am Alif Maharendra Sihombing, stuck from home in Samarinda, East Borneo/Kalimantan, Indonesia who was actual victim of getting ramsomware from ramsomware-laced CloneSpy in mid-2018 (yes, really). As Toei Animation hack affected production of One Piece, Dragon Quest: Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, Digimon Ghost Game, and Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie, I am announcing to sue every People Of Cryptocurrency, including proponents for not listening on growth of ransomware cyberattacks, like:

•Saifedean Ammous

•Nick Szabo

•Michael Saylor

•Giancarlo Devasini

•Craig Wright

•Changpeng Zhao

•Andreas Antonopoulous

•Max Keiser

•Roger Ver

•Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss

•Cynthia Lummis

*Sincerely,*

Alif Maharendra Sihombing
